  outrageous favoritism of their perfectly awful son Dudley leads to some of the most inspired dark comedy since Charlie and the Chocolate 
  Factory. But fortunately for Harry, he\'s about to be granted a scholarship to a unique boarding school called THE HOGWORTS SCHOOL OF 
  WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY, where he will become a school hero at the game of Quidditch (a kind of aerial soccer played high above the ground 
  on broomsticks), he will make some wonderful friends, and, unfortunately, a few terrible enemies. For although he seems to be getting your 
  run-of-the-mill boarding school experience (well, ok, even that\'s pretty darn out of the ordinary), Harry Potter has a destiny that he was 
  born to fulfill. A destiny that others would kill to keep him from.', 13.49, 'J.K. Rowling', 115, '‎Scholastic Press (October 1, 1998)',

  and Wizardry. But just as he\'s packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if 
  Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And strike it does. For in Harry\'s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor,
 Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls\' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley\'s younger 
 sister, Ginny. But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. 
Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it 
be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?', 11.94, 'J.K. Rowling', 125, 'Scholastic (July 1, 1999)',

  Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter\'s defeat of You-Know-Who was Black\'s downfall 
  as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He\'s at Hogwarts . . . he\'s at Hogwarts."Harry Potter isn\'t safe,
  not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their

  perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely
  doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s

  man—whose later infamy would overshadow his brilliance on the Belgica; and the ship’s first mate, soon-to-be legendary Roald Amundsen, even
  in his youth the storybook picture of a sailor. Together, they would plan a last-ditch, nearly certain-to-fail escape from the ice—one that

  of stories, and practices not only his native Hinduism, but also Christianity and Islam. When Pi is sixteen, his family emigrates from India
  to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship, along with their zoo animals bound for new homes. 
  The ship sinks. Pi finds himself alone in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker, a
  450-pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi, whose fear, knowledge, and cunning allow him to coexist with Richard
  Parker for 227 days lost at sea. When they finally reach the coast of Mexico, Richard Parker flees to the jungle, never to be seen again.
  The Japanese authorities who interrogate Pi refuse to believe his story and press him to tell them "the truth." After hours of coercion,
  Pi tells a second story, a story much less fantastical, much more conventional-but is it more true? Life of Pi is at once a realistic,
  rousing adventure and a meta-tale of survival that explores the redemptive power of storytelling and the transformative nature of fiction.
